## How to Play
The goal of the game is to combine numbered tiles on a 4x4 grid until you reach the 2048 tile. The game starts with two tiles on the board, each with a value of either 2 or 4. The player can move tiles in any of the four cardinal directions (up, down, left, or right) by using the arrow keys on the keyboard. When two tiles of the same value collide, they combine into a single tile with the sum of their values. After each move, a new tile with a value of either 2 or 4 is added to the board.

To win the game, the player must combine tiles until they reach the 2048 tile. However, the game will continue even after the 2048 tile is reached, and the player can try to achieve a higher score.

## Usage
